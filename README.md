## Improving translations

Edit the applicable `strings_XX.arb` file in `res/values/` and
open a pull request with the changes.

## Current list of language files:

- English
- Russian

## Add a new language

1. Create a new `strings_XX.arb` file in `res/values/`, replacing XX with 
the language's [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1).

2. Edit the strings in this file, replacing XXX below with the translation for each string.

`"welcome" : "Welcome to",` -> `"welcome" : "XXX",`

3. For strings where there is a variable, denoted by a $ symbol and
braces, such as ${status}, the string in braces should not be translated.
For example, when editing line 106:

"time" : "${minutes}m ${seconds}s"

The only parts to be translated, if needed, are the values m and s after the variables.

4. Add the language to `lib/entities/language_service.dart`
under both `supportedLocales` and `localeCountryCode`. Use the name of the language
in the local language and in English in parentheses after for `supportedLocales`. Use
the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)
for `localeCountryCode`. You must choose one country, so choose the country with the most
native speakers of this language or is otherwise best associated with this language.

5. Add a relevant flag to `assets/images/flags/XXXX.png`, replacing XXXX with
the 3 digit localeCountryCode. The image must be 42x26 pixels with a 3 pixels of
transparent margin on all 4 sides. You can resize the flag
with [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) to 36x20 pixels, expand
the canvas to 42x26 pixels with the flag anchored in the middle,
and then manually delete the 3 pixels on each side to make transparent.
Or you can use another program like Photoshop.

## Add a new fiat currency

1. Check with [FossWallet support](https://fosswallet.github.io/guides) to see if the
desired new fiat currency is available through our fiat API. Not all fiat currencies are.

2. If the currency is associated strongly with a specific issuing country,
map the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code with
the applicable [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)
in `lib/entities/fiat_currency.dart`. If the currency is used in a whole region or organization,
then map with a reasonable interpretation of this (eg: eur countryCode for EUR symbol).

3. Add the raw mapping underneath in `lib/entities/fiat_currency.dart` following
the same format as the others.

4. Add a flag of the issuing country or organization to `assets/images/flags/XXXX.png`,
replacing XXXX with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code used above (eg: `usa.png`, `eur.png`).
Do not add this if the flag with the same name already exists. The image must be 42x26
pixels with a 3 pixels of transparent margin on all 4 sides.
